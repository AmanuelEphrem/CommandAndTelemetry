# The code for the flight station

- [x] Implement communication protocol (to send and receive from ground) (implemented for both flight and ground station in CommunicationProtocol.py) 
- [ ] Obtain data from sensor group (SQL?)
- [ ] Obtain data from fault management (websockets?)
- [ ] Organize (using JSON format) and send obtained data using CommunicationProtocol.py
- [ ] Test photo transfer (hopefully it works by just packing it in a JSON)
